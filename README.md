## **Coding ChatGPT from Scratch – SoC IIT Bombay 2025**


Mentee - Pari Soni, 24b4505

Mentor - Shivtej Ghatage

### **Project Goal**
1. Learn about python libraries - numpy, pandas, matlibplot, pytorch
2. Understand the fundamentals of neural networks, attention and transformers
3. Understand the basics and under the hood principles of Chatgpt 


### **What I Have Learned**
I have made notes summarizing my learnings throughout the project, the google doc link for the same is https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hjFC6zUD8Oey5jEuzFY3LHqQJuFaNqowWRHS8wKPaJc/edit?tab=t.0

### **Repository Layout**
1. Harry Potter.txt - This contains the training data which I have used for the project
2. train.py - This contains the main code for training and generating data.

   This includes code for word embedding, Creating training and test data, Bigram language model, Multi head attention, Feed forward layers, 
 loss and optimizer for backpropagation and generating from the model.

Joint replacement returns mobility and life to many patients — but when bacteria take hold on an implant, recovery can be derailed. Prosthetic joint infection (PJI) after primary arthroplasty occurs in roughly 1–2% of cases and is more common after revisions or trauma [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11470562/). Each infected joint often requires staged revision surgery, prolonged intravenous antibiotics, and long periods of disability; direct hospital costs per case in India have been estimated in the ₹15–18 lakh range. At the heart of this clinical failure are biofilms: dense, surface-associated communities — most commonly formed by Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA) and coagulase-negative staphylococci — that
