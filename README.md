## **Coding ChatGPT from Scratch â€“ SoC IIT Bombay 2025**


Mentee - Pari Soni, 24b4505

Mentor - Shivtej Ghatage

### **Project Goal**
1. Learn about python libraries - numpy, pandas, matlibplot, pytorch
2. Understand the fundamentals of neural networks, attention and transformers
3. Understand the basics and under the hood principles of Chatgpt 


### **What I Have Learned**
I have made notes summarizing my learnings throughout the project, the google doc link for the same is https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hjFC6zUD8Oey5jEuzFY3LHqQJuFaNqowWRHS8wKPaJc/edit?tab=t.0

### **Repository Layout**
1. Harry Potter.txt - This contains the training data which I have used for the project
2. train.py - This contains the main code for training and generating data.

   This includes code for word embedding, Creating training and test data, Bigram language model, Multi head attention, Feed forward layers, 
 loss and optimizer for backpropagation and generating from the model.
